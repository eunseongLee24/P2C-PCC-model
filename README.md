# P2C-PCC Model for Turbidity Prediction

This repository provides the implementation of the P2C-PCC deep learning model used in:

**"A Practical P2C-PCC Model for Real-Time Turbidity Prediction at Filtration Sites in Water Treatment Plants"**

The code includes:
- P2C-PCC custom layer implementation  
- Minimal training template  
- Example inference script  
- Required Python dependencies  

Raw turbidity and operational datasets are **not included** due to confidentiality restrictions of the water treatment plant.
